# E-commerce-follow-alone


Milestone 1 

This project is a mentor-led session to build a full-fledged e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It aims to provide hands-on experience in building real-world web applications with scalable and secure features.

The **MERN stack** is a popular technology stack used for building full-stack web applications. It is favored for its **JavaScript-only approach**, which allows developers to use a single programming language (JavaScript) across the entire application, both on the frontend and backend. This approach simplifies development and is particularly beginner-friendly

The MERN stack includes:
- **MongoDB**: 
- **Express.js**
- **React.js**:
- **Node.js**:

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that enables communication between a client and a server using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 

1. **User Authentication**
   - Register new users.
   - Log in existing users securely.
   
2. **Product Management**
   - Add new products.
   - Update product details.
   - Retrieve product data.

3. **Order Handling**
   - Manage customer orders.
   - Provide structured data responses (typically in JSON format).


## Basics of Database Schema Design

In **MongoDB**, schema design is the process of defining the structure and relationships of data stored in the database. This involves:
- Identifying key entities (e.g., Users, Products, Orders).
- Defining fields and their data types.
- Establishing relationships between collections (e.g., linking orders to users).

Good schema design ensures the database is:
- Efficient in handling queries.
- Scalable as the application grows.


## Role of Authentication in Web Applications

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user before granting access to specific resources or functionalities. In our e-commerce application:
- Users will authenticate themselves through secure login mechanisms.
- Only authenticated users can make purchases or access sensitive information like order history.

Key goals of authentication:
- Protect user data.
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Enable a personalized user experience.
